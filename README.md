Make sure you have the following installed:

## Getting Started
Before doing anything sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v22 (or later)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) v5.4.3 (or later)

You can install node using:
#### for windows:
```
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS // For windows
```
#### for mac:
```
brew install node
```
#### for Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Then you can install TypeScript globally using npm:

```
npm install -g typescript
```



## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file, These are the default values if ones are not set.

`NODE_ENV=development`
`VITE_BACKEND_URL=localhost` 
`VITE_BACKEND_PORT=3000`
`ACCESS_SECRET=sloppyKissesFromGrandma552`
`REFRESH_SECRET=sloppyKissesFromGrandma225`
`MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/`
`VITE_FRONTEND_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug` 
`BACKEND_LOGGING_LEVEL= debug`

Note that the default values for `MONGO_URI` and `VITE_FRONTEND_LOGGING_LEVEL` will change when `NODE_ENV` is set to production, becoming `mongodb://mongo:27017` and `slient` respectively.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/The-Sofishticated-Man/secret-message
```

Go to the project directory

```
cd my-project
```

Install client dependencies

```
cd client
npm install
```
Start frontend server

```
npm run dev
```
Install server dependencies

```
cd server
npm install
```
Start backend server

```
npm run dev
```




## Deployment

The way I initally made this, for the backend, you can just run docker compose and deploy your containers on any cloud provider.

However for the frontend, you can use many different hosting options like vercel, cloudflare, or github pages.

I *would* have made it a docker image aswell and served it with nginx but honestly I couldn't be arsed üóø.

### Deploy the frontend using github pages.
To deploy this project to github pages, start by forking this repository, clone it, then navigate to the client folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-forked-repo.git
cd your-forked-repo/client
```

Then, you're gonna have to edit the package. file and add your urls, (replace your username and repo-name)
```
"homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name"
```

After that it's just one simple command
```
npm run deploy
```
### Deploy the backend using docker.
This one is much simpler, just head to your cloud provider's cli or whatever environment you're using, make sure you're in the the project's root directory and run:
```
docker compose up --build backend
```
this will attach it to your backend container which is useful for debugging logs.
